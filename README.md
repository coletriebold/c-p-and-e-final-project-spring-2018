# Arduino Drink Mixer

Our project is an automatic drink mixer that can be operated with the press of 3 buttons.

## Team

John Sha, Jerome Wang, Natya Admira Dharmosetio, Cole Triebold

## Summary

We set out to create the finest drink mixer ever seen in Des Inv 23. Our goal was to create fine mixed drinks using simple arduino components. We created a menu of ten drinks, which the user can choose by pressing 3 buttons in different sequences. After the input is placed, our mixer rotates a cup using a lazy-susan system. Once it reaches the first position, the parasaltic pump is activated and begins to dispense liquid. This process is repeated for each ingredient of the drink, until it is properly mixed. Each pre-set drink has a measured amount of each ingredient added. 

## Component Parts

- 6 Parasaltic Pumps
- 4 1/4 inch wood sheets
- 20 ft of 4mm tubing
- Buttons
- Arduino/breadboard/wires
- Lazy Susan Ball Bearing
- DC motor
- 3D printed gear
- 6 Bottles of beverages for mixing

Inputs: 3 Button interface to input what beverage or beverage mixture is desired and how much to dispense (proportion of each liquid and total liquid volume). These will be routed through the Arduino board.

Outputs: Different nozzles pouring different types of liquids into the cup to create the perfect beverage. We will need to optimize the mix levels to create the best drinks for a given volume.

## Challenges

The largest challenge we encountered was choosing how to dispense the liquids from the bottles into the cup. We messed around with many different concepts, but ended up going with parasaltic pumps. If we were to do this again, I would try and use a faster method of pumping the liquid. 


## Timeline

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Obtain all components, test methods of liquid dispensing, begin constructing the wood assembly
- Week 3: Continue building assembly and work out pumping issues
- Week 4: Work on electronics and hook up components
- Week 5: Present!
